# Lintcode 2960//Naive
# Description
# You are asked to define a function return_hello that returns a string 'hello'.

# Example
# The evaluation machine will execute your code via python main.py. There is no input data for this question, so please define a function in solution.py named my_name that returns a string. We will execute your code in main.py, and you can see the exact execution steps in main.py.
# Output.
# hello

# Notice how to define a function without an argument

def my_name():
    return 'hello'
