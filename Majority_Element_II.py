# Lintcode 47//Medium

# Description
# Given an array of integers, the majority number is the number that occurs more than 1/3 of the size of the array.
# Find it.
# There is only one majority number in the array.

# Example
# Example 1:
# Input:
# nums = [99,2,99,2,99,3,3]
# Output:
# 99
# Explanation:
# 99 appeared three times.

# Example 2:
# Input:
# nums = [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3, 3]
# Output:
# 1
# Explanation:
# 1 appeared three times.

# Challenge
# O(n) time and O(1) extra space.

    List,

    # 1. Can nums be empty?
    # 2. Is the existence of such a number guaranteed and unique?
